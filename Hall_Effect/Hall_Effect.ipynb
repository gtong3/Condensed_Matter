    "Use this template as a starting point to carry out the analysis tasks.  For reference, here are links to recommended Python resources: the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) and the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) both by Jake VanderPlas.\n",

    "## Standard Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good idea at the beginning of your notebook to include the packages that you will need.  We will use those shown below here.  A brief description:\n",
    "* `numpy` is the foundational package for Python numerical work. It extends and speeds up array operations beyond standard Python, and it includes almost all math functions that you would need for example `sqrt()` (square root) or `cos()` (cosine).  These would be written in code as `np.sqrt()` or `np.cos()`.\n",
    "* `scipy` is a huge collection of scientific data analysis functions, routines, physicical constants, etc.  This is the second most used package for scientific work. Here we will use the physical constants library, `scipy.constants`.  Documentation is at [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) with the constants subpackage at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html.\n",
    "* `uncertainties` is a very useful small package that simplifies uncertainty propagation and printing out of quantities with uncertainty. Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is *the* standard plotting package for scientific Python.  We will use a subset called `pyplot` which is modeled after the plotting functions used in MATLAB. The last line below, `%matplotlib inline`, simply forces the plots to appear within the notebook.\n",
    "* `pandas` is a large data science package.  It's main feature is a set of methods to create and manipulate a \"DataFrame,\" which is an enlargement of the idea of an array.  I plays well with NumPy and other packages.  We will use it mainly as a way to read files into data sets in an easy way.\n",
    "* [LMFit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) is excellent for carrying out line and curve fits with many useful features."

    "1. If not already done, enter the raw data into a spreadsheet, save the file(s) and make them available to the members of the group.  You should have at least 4 different tables: measurements for each probe plus the measurements of the magnetic field\n",
    "2. Import the magnetic field measurements.  Calculate a mean and standard deviation for the magnetic field $B$ at the location of the probes between the poles.\n",
    "3. Import the measurements from each probe. Calculate $2V_H$ for each value of $I_x$  for each probe, as described in the instructions.  Show a code snippet that does this or describe the calculation in your group notebook with an example.\n",
    "4. Plot $2V_H$ versus $I_x$  for each sample and fit a line to it using LMfit.  Obtain the fit coefficients and their uncertainty.\n",
    "5. Calculate the Hall coefficient $R_H$ for each probe and propagate the uncertainty from the fit, uncertainty in the magnetic field, and uncertainties in the probe specifications given in Table 1 in the instructions.\n",
    "6. Determine the source of the largest statistical uncertainty, and explain how this was determined. \n",
    "7. Calculate the conductivity of the sample material and its uncertainty for all three samples.\n",
    "8. Calculate the Hall mobility $\\mu$ for the InAs probe.  (You can also calculate a mobility for the metal probes, but its meaning is suspect.)"
