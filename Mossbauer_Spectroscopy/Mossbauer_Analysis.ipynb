    "1. Use the peak-to-peak amplitude from the velocity transducer and to create a calibration function (a line).  You will need the function generator period and MCS dwell time.  The function should return a velocity in mm/s given a channel number.  Negative velocities should indicate negative energy shifts, and positive velocities should indicate positive energy shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply your calibration function to the peak-position data sets for all spectral peaks. Record these results in tables, one table for each sample.  You want an ordered table of absorption peaks in units of mm/s.  Recommended: Make a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then run the following calculations, depending on your samples\n",
    "    * For **enriched iron &amp; natural iron**: Calculate (1) the isomer shift in mm/s, (2) the magnitide of the internal magnetic field in tesla and (3) the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the excited state in units of the nuclear magneton.  Compare values to expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For **sodium nitroprusside**: Calculate (1) the isomer shift in mm/s, (2) the quadrupole splitting in mm/s. Then calculate the isomer shift compared to enriched Fe. Compare your value to expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For **stainless steel**: Calculate (1) the isomer shift in mm/s of the single peak.  Then calculate the isomer shift realtive to enriched Fe.  Compare your value to the expected result.  Also calculate the peak width in velocity units to compare to the peak widths for enriched Fe and discuss whether you see evidence of a weak internal field (as opposed to zero internal field).\n",
