    "Use this template as a starting point to carry out the analysis tasks.  For reference, here are links to recommended Python resources: the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) and the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) both by Jake VanderPlas.\n",

    "## Standard Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good idea at the beginning of your notebook to include the packages that you will need.  We will use those shown below here.  A brief description:\n",
    "* `numpy` is the foundational package for Python numerical work. It extends and speeds up array operations beyond standard Python, and it includes almost all math functions that you would need for example `sqrt()` (square root) or `cos()` (cosine).  These would be written in code as `np.sqrt()` or `np.cos()`.\n",
    "* `scipy` is a huge collection of scientific data analysis functions, routines, physicical constants, etc.  This is the second most used package for scientific work. Here we will use the physical constants library, `scipy.constants`.  Documentation is at [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) with the constants subpackage at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html.\n",
    "* `uncertainties` is a very useful small package that simplifies uncertainty propagation and printing out of quantities with uncertainty. Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is *the* standard plotting package for scientific Python.  We will use a subset called `pyplot` which is modeled after the plotting functions used in MATLAB. The last line below, `%matplotlib inline`, simply forces the plots to appear within the notebook.\n",
    "* `pandas` is a large data science package.  It's main feature is a set of methods to create and manipulate a \"DataFrame,\" which is an enlargement of the idea of an array.  I plays well with NumPy and other packages.  We will use it mainly as a way to read files into data sets in an easy way.\n",
    "* [LMFit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) is excellent for carrying out line and curve fits with many useful features."

    "## Task Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The SPR modeling analysis program creates a curve following the reflectance formula given in the paper by Simon, Mitchell and Watson, Eq. (11).  Your task is to recreate this function with Python code and plot it under your data points for at least one or two data sets.  This will give you deeper insight into the fitting formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating functions for the quantities that go into Eq. (11).  These are Eqs. (7), (9b) and (9c), along with Eqs. (10a) and (10b).  The quantities that feed in are the complex dielectric permittivity  and the index of reflection of the glass $n$, along with $\\omega/c=k_0=2\\pi/\\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then combine the functions into a single one that gives the reflectance R, Eq. (11).\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful to convert your angles from degrees to radians before feeding them to the functions!  (This is the most common mistake students make.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to make sure all quantities are represented by complex data types, even if the physical quantity is real-valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a working function, you may try to see if you can make it work with LMfit.  In principal this is possible, but prepare for some challenges if your function is not of the required form for LMfitâ€™s library calls. \n"
